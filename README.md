# StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project  

This is the **StayEase** project — a full-stack Airbnb clone built as part of my learning journey to master frontend and backend development.  
The project focuses on creating a functional booking platform where users can browse property listings, view details, and complete bookings.

# React + TypeScript + Vite  

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite**, using React + TypeScript for a fast and modern frontend development experience.  

Currently, two official plugins are available for React:  

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
