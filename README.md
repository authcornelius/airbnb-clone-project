# StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project

This is the **StayEase** project — a full-stack Airbnb clone built as part of my learning journey to master frontend and backend development.  
The project focuses on creating a functional booking platform where users can browse property listings, view details, and complete bookings.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite**, using React + TypeScript for a fast and modern frontend development experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# UI Component Patterns

To make StayEase scalable and maintainable, we’ll build reusable UI components that maintain consistency across the application.

### 🔝 Navbar

- Displays **logo**, **search bar**, and **user menu** (login/profile).
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.

### 🏡 Property Card

- Shows **property image**, **price**, **location**, and **rating**.
- Includes a **favorite button** for saving listings.
- Used in the property listing page grid.

### 📑 Footer

- Provides **site links** (About, Contact, FAQs).
- Shows **company info** and **social media links**.
- Always visible as the last section of each page.

---

### 🎯 Importance of UI Component Patterns

- **Reusability** → write once, use anywhere.
- **Consistency** → same look and behavior across the app.
- **Scalability** → easier to extend features in the future.
- **Collaboration** → designers and developers can share a common design system.

# 🏡 StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint

## 📖 About the Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a real-world, full-stack application designed to simulate the development of a scalable booking platform.  
The backend (StayBackend) focuses on **robust system architecture, database design, API development, and application security**—mirroring real challenges in industry-grade software.

This project will help learners:

- Understand **backend workflows & architecture**.
- Implement **secure REST & GraphQL APIs**.
- Design **relational databases** for booking systems.
- Gain hands-on experience with **CI/CD pipelines** and **team collaboration**.
